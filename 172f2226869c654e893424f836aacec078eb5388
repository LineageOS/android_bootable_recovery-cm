      "message": "Yes, though since the update-binary is included in the zip, I guess it doesn\u0027t matter that much for existing OTA files.\n\nMy assumption is that future changes may actually make use of the second argument, so it seems best to just leave it there. However, if you disagree - then we can change it, but we also need to change the releasetools (https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_build/blob/cm-11.0/tools/releasetools/ota_from_target_files)",
